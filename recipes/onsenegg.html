  <h1>Best way to make an authentic onsen egg</h1>
  <img src="./onsen egg.webp" alt="onsen egg">
  <br>
  <p>An onsen egg is a silky, custardy, perfectly cooked egg with a light soy broth</p>
  <br>
  <p>What you need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) mirin</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (8g) sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120ml) soy sauce</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (180ml) homemade or instant dashi</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cooking steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For the Eggs, If Using an Immersion Circulator: Following manufacturer's instructions, preheat water bath to 167°F
    (75°C). When water is ready, add shell-on eggs and cook for 13 minutes. Transfer to an ice bath to chill. Eggs can be
    refrigerated, shell on, for up to 2 days.</li>
    <li>For the Eggs, If Using a Pot and an Instant-Read Digital Thermometer: Fill a large pot with water and bring to 167°F
    (75°C). Add shell-on eggs and cook for 13 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain temperature. Alternatively,
    transfer hot water to a cooler, add eggs, and cook for 13 minutes, using extra boiling or cold water to adjust heat to
    maintain 167°F. A small fluctuation of a degree or two up or down is okay; just do your best to maintain the temperature
    the entire time. Transfer eggs to an ice bath to chill. Eggs can be refrigerated, shell on, for up to 2 days.</li>
    <li>For the Soy-Dashi Broth (optional): While eggs cook, bring mirin to a simmer over medium heat in a small saucepan. Add
    sugar and stir to dissolve. Add soy sauce, stir well, and bring to a simmer. Remove this kaeshi mixture from heat and
    transfer to refrigerator to cool.</li>
    <li> UWhen ready to serve, combine 1/4 cup kaeshi (soy-mirin) mixture with 3/4 cup dashi. Any additional kaeshi and dashi can
    be reserved for another use. (Mixed together, as in this recipe, they make an excellent cold dipping broth for chilled
    soba or udon noodles.)</li>
    <li>Working with one at a time, carefully crack eggs and peel off enough of the shell to slide the egg out into a small
    mixing bowl. Using a spoon and/or a clean paper towel, carefully separate soft-cooked egg from any loose whites. Slide
    each egg into a small serving bowl, pour broth around it, and garnish with scallions. Serve.</li>
